# Climate Change Bot

The goal of this project is to develop a chatbot that answers questions about climate change. The chatbot will be developed in the context of the master thesis of Roger Waldvogel. If there is interest, the chatbot will be further developed after the completion of the master thesis. The work is expected to be completed on June 3, 2023. 

## Subprojects

As a frontend, a [website](https://github.com/climate-change-bot/website) will be developed using vue.js. [Rasa](https://rasa.com/) open source will be used for the development of the [chatbot](https://github.com/climate-change-bot/chatbot). For the analysis of the communication, another project will be created.
